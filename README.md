# VIAT: Viewpoint-Invariant Adversarial Training
This repository contains the official implementation of VIAT and GMVFool for the paper ["Towards Viewpoint-Invariant Visual Recognition via Adversarial Training"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10235.pdf) (ICCV2023) 

and ["Improving viewpoint robustness for visual recognition via adversarial training"](https://scholar.google.cz/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=1pggtuUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=1pggtuUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC) (Extended Version)

## ⚙️ 1.Prerequisites
Ensure that you have these environments:
- Pytorch (1.11.0)
- torchvision (0.13.1)
- timm (0.5.4)
- pytorch-lighting(1.6.5)
  
1. For the complete running environment of VIAT, please refer to `./requirements.txt`.
2. (🔥**Extremely important**) Please ensure to follow the [ngp_pl(Instant-NGP based on pytorch-lighting)](https://github.com/kwea123/ngp_pl) to install the relevant environment for Instant-NGP, since VIAT and GMVFool depend on Instant-NGP for viewpoint rendering.

## 💾 2.Datasets
The released data consists of two parts: 
1. `IM3D`: A multi-view dataset used for training, containing 100 hemispherical sampled viewpoint renderings of 1000 virtual 3D objects.
- [IM3D download link (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_A4ePjOhlJahJpy8T2dgWZLoigKmqqSd/view?usp=drive_link)

2. `ImageNet-V+`, A larger adversarial viewpoint benchmark, including 100K adversarial viewpoint samples captured by GMVFool on IM3D.
- [IM3D download link (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oxrWl4mRa_mEr-ByCMhyRWaQG8Wribo7/view)


## 🪄 3.Training NeRF for IM3D Objects
Before beginning, we need to use Instant-NGP to construct NeRF representations for the 1000 objects in IM3D, which will take approximately 24 hours. However, if you only want to conduct attacks or run simple demos, you can opt to train NeRF for a subset of the objects. Due to limited upload space, I regret that I cannot directly share the NeRF weights.

If you have correctly downloaded the `IM3D` dataset, extract it into a folder within the project. Then, training nerf can be conducted using the following script:

```
cd ./run_train_nerf
sh run_train_NeRF_1.sh
```
Note that you should modified `--root_dir` in `run_train_NeRF_1.sh` to the path of `IM3D` datasets, and the checkpoint will be saved in `.\run_train_NeRF\ckpts\nerf`
